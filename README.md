This is Python code that I wrote for some survey data analysis. The survey was
carried out on survey monkey and the raw data returned as a .csv format.
It utilises Pandas, numpy and matplotlib libraries.

The code was originally written on Google Colaboratory which uses a Jupyter Notebook
format, which allows you to view plots and tabular data inline with the code.
